The theory for each model can be found in the notion mentioned above.
The implementation of the model can be found in this repository under the directory with it's name.
Each directory has three examples. The first one is the implementation of the model from scratch, the second one is the implementation of the model using one library and the third one is the implementation of the model using a dataset and creating a production ready model.
